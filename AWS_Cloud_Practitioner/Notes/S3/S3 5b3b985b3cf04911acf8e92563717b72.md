# S3

Created: Nov 3, 2020 4:41 PM

- Use Cases
    - Backup and storage
    - Disaster Recovery
    - Archive
    - Hyprid Cloud Storage
    - Application hosting
    - Media hosting
    - Data lakes & big data analytics
    - Software delivery
    - Static website
- Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in "buckets" (directories)
- Buckets must have a **globally unique name**
- **Buckets are defined at the region level**
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- **Naming convention**
    - No uppercase
    - No underscore
    - 3-63 characters long
    - Not an IP
    - Must start with lowercase letter or number
- Objects have a Key, which is the full path of the file
- The key is composed of the prefix + object name —> s3://my-bucket/my_folderl/another_folder/my_file.txt
- Max Object Size is 5 TB, but can only upload up to 5GB at once, if more, need to use **multi-part upload.**

## S3 Security

- User Based
    - IAM policies
- Resource Based
    - Bucket Policies
    - Object Access Control List (ACL) - finer grain
    - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - less common
- Encryption
    - encrypt objects in Amazon S3 using encryption keys
- S3 Bucket Policies are JSON based policies:
    - **Resources:** buckets and objects
    - **Actions:** set of API to Allow or Deny
    - **Effect:** Allow/Deny
    - **Principal:** The account or user to apply the policy to

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the web (www)
- The website URL will be:

    ```
    <bucket-name>.s3-website-<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
    OR
    <bucket-name>.s3-website.<AWS-region>.amazonaws.com
    ```

- **If you get a 403 error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!**

## S3 Versioning

- enbaled at the **bucket level**
- same key overwrite will increment the "version" : 1,2,3 ...
- Allows you to preform **rollbacks** if there's an error in your current version

## S3 Access Logs

- for audit purpose, you may want to log all access
- Any request made to S3 will be logged into another S3 bucket

### S3 Replication

- Asynchronous replication is when you want objects in one bucket to be saved in another bucket as well in a different region
    - **Must enable versioning** in source & destination
- Cross Region Replication (CRR)
    - Use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
- Same Region Replication (SRR)
    - Use cases: log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts

### S3 Storage Classes

- **Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose**
    - 99.99% Availability
    - used for freqently accessed data
    - low latency and high throughput
    - Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures.
    - **Use cases:** Big Data Analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution
- **Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)**
    - when you know the file won't be frequently accessed but is always **readily available when needed**
    - 99.9% availability
    - lower cost compared to Amazon S3 Standard, but retrieval fee
    - Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures
    - **Use cases:** data store for disaster recovery, backups ...
- **Amaon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access**
    - file that you can re-create over time and don't face the risk of losing it
    - stored in one AZ
    - 99.5% Availability
    - low latency & high throughput performance
    - Lower cost compared to S3-IA (by 20%)
    - **Use Cases:** Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or storing data you can recreate.
- **Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering**
    - if you're not sure whether to place the file in standard infrequent or one zone infrequent
    - 99.9% Availability
    - same low latency & high throughput performance of S3 Standard
    - **Cost-optimized by** automatically moving objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns:
        - frequent access
        - Infrequent access
    - Resilient against events that impact an entire Availability Zone
- **Amazon Glacier (cheap)**
    - Backup & Archives
    - low cost object storage (GB/month)
    - data is retained for the longer term
    - Fees for retrieval:
        - Expedited ( 1 to 5 mins)
        - Standard ( 3 to 5 hours)
        - Bulk ( 5 to 12 hours)
- **Amazon Glacier Deep Archive (cheapest)**
    - If it is expected that the Backup & Archives will take long to pull out.
    - fees for retrieval:
        - Standard (12 hours)
        - Bulk (48 hours)

## S3 Durability and Availability

- Durability
    - How often will you lose a file?
        - High Durability, 99.99999999999% ( 11 9's) of objects across multiple AZ
- Availability
    - measures how readily available a service is
    - S3 standard has 99.99% availability, ~53 minutes a yeara
    - varies depending on storage class

## S3 - Moving between storage classes

- you can transition objects between storage classes

- *infrequent accessed objects —> STANDARD_IA*
- *objects you don't need in real-time —> GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE*
- Moving objects can be automated using a **lifecycle configuration**

### Shared Responsibility Model for S3

## Amazon Snowball

- Physical data transport solution that helps in moving TBs or PBs of data in or out of AWS.
- Alternative to moving data over the network
- Pay per data transfer job
- **Use case:** large data cloud migrations, DC decommission, disaster recovery.
- *If it takes more than a week to transfer over the network, use **Snowball devices.***

### Snowball Edge

- Snowball Edges (100 TB), add computational capability to the device
- supports custom EC2 AMI to perform computation **on the go**
- Very useful for pre-process the data while moving
- **UseCase:** data migration, image collation, IoT capture, machine learning
- *Snowball is deprecated in favor of Snowball Edge*

### AWS Snowmobile

- Transfer exabytes of data ( 1 EB = 1000 PB = 1 000 000 TBs)
- Each snowmobile has 100 PB of capacity
- Better than **Snowball** if you transfer more than 10 PB

## Storage Gateway (Hybrid Cloud for Storage)

- Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
- Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
- This can be due to:
    - Long cloud migrations
    - Security requirements
    - Compliance requirements
    - IT strategy

![S3%205b3b985b3cf04911acf8e92563717b72/Untitled%203.png](S3%205b3b985b3cf04911acf8e92563717b72/Untitled%203.png)

- **Use cases:** disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage
- Types of Storage Gateway:
    - File Gateway
    - Volumes Gateway
    - Tape Gateway

![S3%205b3b985b3cf04911acf8e92563717b72/Untitled%204.png](S3%205b3b985b3cf04911acf8e92563717b72/Untitled%204.png)

- Just know that the AWS Storage Gateway allows you to bridge whatever happens on premises with your storage(s) directly to the cloud.

## Questions

- Snowball Edge is best-suited to move petabytes of data and offers computing capabilities. Be careful, it's recommended to use a fleet of Snowballs to move less than 10PBs of data. Over this quantity, it's better-suited to use Snowmobile.
- Snowmobile is used to move exabytes of data in or out of AWS (1 EB=1,000 PBs=1,000,000 TBs).
- **Objects aren't composed of Access Keys.** Access Keys are used to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API.
- Buckets store objects in Amazon S3.
- Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access allow you to store infrequently accessed data, with rapid access when needed, has a high durability, and is stored in several Availability Zones to avoid data loss in case of a disaster. It can be used to store data for disaster recovery, backups, etc.
