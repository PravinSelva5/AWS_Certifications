## DDoS Protection:  WAF & Shield

- Distributed Denial-Of-Services
- **AWS Shield Standard** can be used to protect yourself from DDoS attacks at no additional costs
- **AWS Shield Advanced** can be used for premium 24/7 DDoS protection
- **AWS WAF** can be used to filter specific requests based on rules
- **CloudFront and Route 53**  can be used for availability protecting using global edge network. If you combine this with AWS Shield, it **provides attack mitigation at the edge**
- Be ready to scale - **leverage AWS AutoScaling in case of an attack**

- **AWS Shield Standard - free, provides protection from attachs such as SYN/UDP Floods, Reflection attacks, and other layer 3/ layer 4 attacks**
- **AWS Shield Advanced:** Provides sophisticated attack on **Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, CloudFront, Global Accelerator, and Route 53**.
- 24/7 Access to **AWS DDoS response team** (DRP)
- **AWS WAF - Web Application Firewall,** protects web applications from web exploits. You can deploy **Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront**
    - You can define Web Access Control List

## Penetration Testing

- Customers can carry out security assesments **without prior approval for 8 services:**
    - Amazon EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, and Elastic Load Balancers
    - Amazon RDS
    - Amazon CloudFront
    - Amazon Aurora
    - Amazon API Gateways
    - AWS Lambda and Lambda Edge functions
    - Amazon Lightsail resources

## Encryption with KMS (Key Management Service) & CloudHSM

- Anytime you hear "encryption" for an AWS service, it's most likely KMS
- KMS =  AWS manages the software for encryption
- CloudHSM = AWS provisions encryption hardware ( Dedicated Hardware = HSM = Hardware Security Module)
    - you manage your own encryption keys

    ![Security%20&%20Compliance%2017107e70f48e48d99663f0b07801e319/Untitled%206.png](Security%20&%20Compliance%2017107e70f48e48d99663f0b07801e319/Untitled%206.png)

- Types of KMS Keys
    - Customer Manager CMK
    - AWS managed CMK
    - CloudHSM Keys (custom keystore)

## Secrets Manager

- you can force **rotation of secrets every X days**
- Integration with Amazon RDS
- Secret are encrypted using KMS

## Artifact

- portal that provides on-demand access to AWS compliance document and AWS agreements
- **Can be used to support internal audi or compliance**

## GuardDuty

- Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account
- One click to enable (30 days trial), no need to install software
