# What is Cloud Computing?

Created: Oct 28, 2020 1:14 PM

- On-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources.
- pay as you go pricing
- provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- access instantly
- easy to access servers, storage, databases, and a set of application services

## The Deployment Models of the Cloud

- Private Cloud (not exposed to public)
- Public Cloud
    - examples: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud
- Hybrid Cloud
    - some servers on premises & extend some capabilities to the Cloud

## Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. On-demand self service
2. Broad network access 
3. Multi-tenancy & resource pooling
4. Rapid elasticity & scalability
5. Measured Service

## Six Advantages of Cloud Computing

1. Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
2. Benefit from massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers
6. Go global in minutes

## Problems solved by the Cloud

1. Flexibility 
2. Cost-Effectiveness
3. Scalability
4. Elasticity
5. High-availability & fault tolerance
6. Agility ( *rapidly develop, test and launch software applications* )

## Types of Cloud Computing

1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
    - example: EC2
2. Platform as a Service (PasS)
    - removes any need to manage any underlying infrastructure
    - Elastic BeanStalk
    - Heroku, Google App Engine
3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
    - Completed product that is run & managed by the service provider
    - example: ReKognition for Machine Learning, Gmail, DropBox

## Pricing of the Cloud

- AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals:
    - **Pay as you go**
        - Compute - Pay for compute time
        - Storage - pay for data stored in Cloud
        - Data transfer OUT of the Cloud is charged, INTO CLOUD is free
- AWS Regions are essentially a cluster of data centers.
- Each availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
    - They're connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
